Expect nothing useful or innovative here -- I'm using this to continue learning and practicing coding (Mainly Java)

It started as a "school management system" walkthrough that I found suggested online. While I was working on it, I found myself thinking that it 
seemed very basic, and not especially realistic in terms of requirements from a user. I'm planning on continuing to add improvements as I think of 
them, but I have no idea how long I'll actively be working on this.
